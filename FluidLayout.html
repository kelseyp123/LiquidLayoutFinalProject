      <p class= "biography">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ann Tsukamoto, Executive Vice President of Scientific
       and Strategic Alliances, was an undergraduate at UC San Diego. She reviewed 3 PhD at 
       UCLA and her postdoctoral research with Harold Varmus at US+CSF. From around 1989-1997 
       she joined a biotech company called SyStemix. There she was involved with isolation of 
       the hematopoietic stem cell. Later, in 1998 she going StemCells Inc. , here she had 
       held several leadership roles as she oversaw isolation and application of human neural 
       and liver stem cells applying to many diseases. </p>

<h2>Stem Cell Summary</h2>
<p class="biography">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stem cells have two important characteristics
 that make it easy to tell the difference in the types of cells. The U.S. National 
 Institute of Health tells us that they are first unspecialized cells that renew themselves 
 for long periods through cell division. Another is that under certain physiologic or
  experimental conditions, they can be induced to become cells with special functions such 
  as beating cells of the heart or the insulin producing cells of the pancreas. A stem 
  cell is an undifferentiated cell of a multicellular organism that is capable of giving 
  rise to indefinitely more cells of the same type, and from which certain other kinds
   of cell arise by differentiation.</p>
